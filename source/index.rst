   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Trust Database for Humans
=========================

Certifi is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for
verifying domains, hosts, and establishing secure connections via TLS (SSL),
extracted from the `Requests <http://python-requests.org>`_ project.

The internet is an untrusted place. Every HTTP request you make should have
verification on by default. This happens every time you access a website with
your web browser, without any knowledge to the user — there's no reason your
code should be any different.

Certifi is here to make this possible.
