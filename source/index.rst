Certifi: Domain Trust for Humans
================================

Certifi is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for
verifying domains, hosts, and establishing secure connections vis TLS (SSL).

The internet is an untrusted place. Every HTTP request you make should have
verification on by default. This happens every time you access a website with
your web browser, without any knowledge to the user — there's no reason your
code should be any different.

Certify is here to make this possible.
