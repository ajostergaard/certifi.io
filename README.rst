Certifi.io
==========

Certifi is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for verifying domains, hosts, and establishing secure connections via TLS (SSL), extracted from the Requests project.

The internet is an untrusted place. Every HTTP request you make should have verification on by default. This happens every time you access a website with your web browser, without any knowledge to the user — there’s no reason your code should be any different.

Certifi is here to make this possible.
